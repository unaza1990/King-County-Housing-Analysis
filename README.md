# King County Housing Market Analysis 🏡

This project analyzes housing prices in King County, Washington using advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques. It was conducted as part of my final achievement for the Data Analytics Immersion Program at CareerFoundry.

## 📊 Objective
To identify key factors affecting house prices, uncover patterns, segment the market using clustering, and forecast price trends using time series modeling.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Tableau (for dashboard and storytelling)
- Folium (for mapping)
- Quandl (for time series data)

## 📁 Project Structure

- `6.2 Exploring Relationships.ipynb`: EDA of pricing trends
- `6.3 Geographical Visualizations.ipynb`: Choropleth map using Folium
- `6.4 Regression.ipynb`: Linear regression model for price prediction
- `6.5 Clustering.ipynb`: K-means clustering on housing features
- `6.6 Time Series.ipynb`: Forecasting with moving averages
- `KC_House_Data_Cleaning_Unaza.ipynb`: Data cleaning & preparation
- `cleaned_kc_house_data.csv`: Final cleaned dataset
- `6.1 Sourcing Open Data.pdf`: Data sourcing document

## 📈 Key Insights
- Larger homes in specific regions demand significantly higher prices
- K-means clustering revealed distinct buyer segments
- Time series forecast shows seasonal price variation with a future upward trend

## 📉 Limitations
- The dataset is limited to historical sales; real-time factors (interest rates, inflation) are not included
- External market influencers like zoning laws or nearby school ratings are not available in the dataset

## 💡 Next Steps
- Build a dashboard for real estate agents to track price trends by zip code
- Integrate mortgage rate data into predictive modeling
- Expand to statewide housing analysis
